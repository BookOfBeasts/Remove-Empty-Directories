Remove Empty Directories (RED)
==============================

RED searches, displays and deletes empty directories recursively below a given start folder.
Furthermore it allows you to create custom rules for keeping and deleting folders (e.g. treat
directories with empty files as empty).


## Features

- Simple user interface
- Shows empty directories before deleting them
- Supports multiple delete modes (including Delete to recycle bin)
- Allows white and black listing of directories by using filter lists
- Can detect directories with empty files as empty


## System requirements

- Windows 7 or 10 (Version 2.2 should still work with older Windows versions like XP or Vista)
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.2 or later (the installer checks and installs the framework)


## Development

RED was developed by [Jonas John](http://www.jonasjohn.de/) ([@hxseven](http://twitter.com/hxseven)) and various contributors.
